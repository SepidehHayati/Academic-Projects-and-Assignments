# Data Engineering Project with SQL 

## 1. Data Warehouse (Organize, Structure, Prepare)

This phase focuses on preparing and organizing raw data into a structured and optimized format suitable for analysis.

- **ETL/ELT Processing**: Extract, Transform, and Load data into a data warehouse.
- **Data Architecture**: Design a scalable and efficient data architecture.
- **Data Integration**: Combine data from multiple sources into a unified view.
- **Data Cleansing**: Remove inconsistencies and ensure data quality.
- **Data Load**: Load processed data into the warehouse.
- **Data Modeling**: Design schemas (star/snowflake) and define relationships.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Understand Data)

This phase is about discovering patterns and gaining initial insights into the data.

- **Basic Queries**: Perform simple `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, etc.
- **Data Profiling**: Understand data distributions, nulls, and types.
- **Simple Aggregations**: Use `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `GROUP BY`.
- **Subqueries**: Write nested queries for intermediate data processing.

## 3. Advanced Data Analytics (Answer Business Questions)

This phase is aimed at providing business insights using advanced SQL techniques.

- Use complex joins, window functions, and conditional logic.
- Develop reports and KPIs.
- Support decision-making through query-driven insights.
- window function
- CTE
- Subqueries
- Reports

# Definitions related to the Project:
## What is ETL?

### Extraction (E)
- Extraction method (push extraction, pull extraction)
- Extract types (full extraction, incremental extraction: moving the data to the Data Warehouse, which has changed)
- Extract technique (ŸêManual Data Extraction, Database Quering, File Parsing, API Calls, Event Base Streaming, SDS, Web Scraping)

### Transformation (T)
- Data Enrichment
- Data Integration
- Derived columns
- Data Cleansing (Remove Duplicate, Data Filtering, Handling Missing Data, Handling invalid values, Handling unwanted spaces, Data Type casting, Outlier detector)
- Data Normalization and Standardization
- Business Rules and Logic
- Data Aggrigation

### Load (L)
- Processing Types (Batch processing, Streaming processing)
- Load Method (Full, Incremental)
    * Full Load: Truncate and insert, Update and insert (Upsert), Drop-Create-Insert
    * Incremental Load: Upsert, Append, Merge(Update, Insert, Delete)
- Slowly Changing Dimention (SCD)
    * SDC 0: No Historization
    * SCD 1: Overwrite
    * SCD 2: Historization
