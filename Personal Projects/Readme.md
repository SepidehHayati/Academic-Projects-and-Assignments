# SQL Project

## 1. Data Warehouse (Organize, Structure, Prepare)

This phase focuses on preparing and organizing raw data into a structured and optimized format suitable for analysis.

- **ETL/ELT Processing**: Extract, Transform, and Load data into a data warehouse.
- **Data Architecture**: Design a scalable and efficient data architecture.
- **Data Integration**: Combine data from multiple sources into a unified view.
- **Data Cleansing**: Remove inconsistencies and ensure data quality.
- **Data Load**: Load processed data into the warehouse.
- **Data Modeling**: Design schemas (star/snowflake) and define relationships.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Understand Data)

This phase is about discovering patterns and gaining initial insights into the data.

- **Basic Queries**: Perform simple `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, etc.
- **Data Profiling**: Understand data distributions, nulls, and types.
- **Simple Aggregations**: Use `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `GROUP BY`.
- **Subqueries**: Write nested queries for intermediate data processing.

## 3. Advanced Data Analytics (Answer Business Questions)

This phase is aimed at providing business insights using advanced SQL techniques.

- Use complex joins, window functions, and conditional logic.
- Develop reports and KPIs.
- Support decision-making through query-driven insights.
