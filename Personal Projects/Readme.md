# Data Engineering Project with SQL 
This project demonstrates a complete data pipeline using SQL, including Data Warehousing, ETL/ELT processes, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Advanced Analytics to support business decision-making.
## Part 1: Steps of Project:
Steps of the project:
### 1. Data Warehouse (Organize, Structure, Prepare)
This phase focuses on preparing and organizing raw data into a structured and optimized format suitable for analysis.

- **ETL/ELT Processing**: Extract, Transform, and Load data into a data warehouse.
- **Data Architecture**: Design a scalable and efficient data architecture.
- **Data Integration**: Combine data from multiple sources into a unified view.
- **Data Cleansing**: Remove inconsistencies and ensure data quality.
- **Data Load**: Load processed data into the warehouse.
- **Data Modeling**: Design schemas (star/snowflake) and define relationships.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Understand Data)
This phase is about discovering patterns and gaining initial insights into the data.

- **Basic Queries**: Perform simple `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, etc.
- **Data Profiling**: Understand data distributions, nulls, and types.
- **Simple Aggregations**: Use `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `GROUP BY`.
- **Subqueries**: Write nested queries for intermediate data processing.

### 3. Advanced Data Analytics (Answer Business Questions)
This phase is aimed at providing business insights using advanced SQL techniques.
- Use complex joins, window functions, and conditional logic.
- Develop reports and KPIs.
- Support decision-making through query-driven insights.
- window function
- CTE
- Subqueries
- Reports

## Part 2: Definition and Methods:

### What is ETL?
**ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** is a data integration process that combines data from multiple sources into a single, consistent data store.

#### E: Extraction
- Extraction Methods:
   * Push Extraction
   * Pull Extraction âœ… (Used in this project)

- Extraction Types:
  * Full Extraction âœ… (Used in this project)
  * Incremental Extraction

- Extraction Techniques:
  * Manual Data Extraction
  * Database Querying
  * File Parsing âœ… (Used in this project)
  * API Calls
  * Event-Based Streaming
  * SDS
  * Web Scraping

#### T: Transformation Techniques:
- Data Enrichment
- Data Integration
- Derived Columns
- Data Cleansing:
  * Remove Duplicates
  * Data Filtering
  * Handling Missing Data
  * Handling Invalid Values
  * Trimming Spaces
  * Data Type Casting
  * Outlier Detection
- Data Normalization & Standardization
- Business Rules & Logic
- Data Aggregation

âœ… *All types of transformation are applied in this project*

#### L: Load
- Processing Types (Batch processing, Streaming processing) âœ… (*Batch Processing is used in this project*)
- Load Method (Full, Incremental)
    * Full Load: Truncate and insert, Update and insert (Upsert), Drop-Create-Insert âœ… (*Full Load is Used in this project*)
    * Incremental Load: Upsert, Append, Merge(Update, Insert, Delete)
- Slowly Changing Dimention (SCD)
    * SDC 0: No Historization (we are no going to update anything)
    * SCD 1: Overwrite (we are updating the records with the new information from resources by overwriting the old value; Upsert: Update + Insert and we losse history) âœ… (*Used in this project*)
    * SCD 2: Historization (we insert new recorde without deleting and overwriting the old data)
