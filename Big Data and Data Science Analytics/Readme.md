# Overview of the course Data Science and Big Data Analytics
The course focuses on mastering the rapidly evolving landscape of Big Data and Data Science through hands-on experience. It introduces students to advanced tools, methodologies, and frameworks to extract meaningful insights from large datasets and build predictive models.

# What We Did in the Project
Our project, titled "HR Maze Analytics: Job Change Prediction of Data Scientists," is a collaborative effort by an international team at the University of Pavia. It explores the application of Big Data and Data Science to predict job-seeking intentions among candidates trained in data science. By leveraging machine learning models and advanced analytics, we derived valuable insights into the factors influencing career decisions.

## Workflow
#### Data Acquisition and Preparation
- Used a Kaggle dataset containing candidate demographics, education, and experience data.
- Cleaned the dataset and converted categorical features into usable formats.

#### Big Data Processing
- Implemented Hadoop and Spark for data ingestion and distributed processing.
- Leveraged MongoDB to store processed data and integrate it with Python analytics.
  
#### Machine Learning Models
- Designed and tested models including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.
- Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### Hypotheses Validation
- Hypothesis 1: Candidates with longer experience are less likely to seek new jobs (validated with a Random Forest model).
- Hypothesis 2: Candidates enrolled in university courses are more likely to seek new jobs (validated using Neural Networks).

#### Visualization and Results Interpretation
- Created bar plots and histograms to visualize feature distributions.
- Highlighted predictive factors like education level, relevant experience, and job changes.

#### Tools and Technologies
- Virtual Machine setup 
- Programming Languages: Python, PySpark, PyMongo.
- Frameworks: Hadoop, Spark, MongoDB.
- Visualization analysis: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

## Challenges Encountered
- Connectivity issues in distributed environments (e.g., Hadoop and MongoDB).
- Balancing precision and recall in predictive models.
